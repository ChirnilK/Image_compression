# Image_compression with Haar Wavelets

This is my school project on image compression with Haar Wavelets.

I study a method for compressing a grayscale image. 
The mathematical method is called Haar wavelets - a method based on simply taking arithmetic means and differences.
The theory is explained in this link :

The result will be saved as jpg file but you can compress png file as well.



#class_comp.py

The code is written as a class/object style.
Here you can compress a picture one time which means the picture size will be 1/4 (n/2 x m/2) when original size (m x n).


#Multi comp.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)

In here, you can see the output one piece at a time.
Now you can compresses a image as many times as the you tell it to.(if it's not too small)
