# Image_compression with Haar Wavelets

This is my school project on image compression with Haar Wavelets.

I study a method for compressing a grayscale image. 
The mathematical method is called Haar wavelets - a method based on simply taking arithmetic means and differences.
The theory is explained in this link :
