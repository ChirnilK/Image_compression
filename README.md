# Image_compression with Haar Wavelets

This is my school project on image compression with Haar Wavelets.

I study a method for compressing a grayscale image. 
The mathematical method is called Haar wavelets - a method based on simply taking arithmetic means and differences.
The theory is explained in this link :

#class_comp.py

The code is written as a class/object stile.
Here you can compress a picture one time which means the size will be 1/4 (n/2 x m/2). # when original size (m x n)
